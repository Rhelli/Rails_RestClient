# 💤 RestClient Search - Ruby on Rails

This project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ 'The Global School for Remote Software Developers!').

This project aims at schooling us in the art of using the 'RestClient' gem - an invaluable weapon in the Rails developers' arsenal.

## 🏆 The Project Brief

The specifications and the guide to the project can be found on the ['Warmup: RestClient'](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/let-s-get-building).

As part of a two-part project (the second part to be completed individually), this first half sees us use the ruby gem 'RestClient' in order to make HTTP requests (specifically from [Bing](https://www.bing.com)) and then relay those HTTP responses to the user.

The entire interaction takes place on the command-line and returns the HTTP responses on the command-line.

## 🔭 Technologies & Languages Used

- Ruby 2.6.5
- Ruby on Rails 6.0.2.1
- RestClient 2.1.0 gem
- Rubocop 0.79.0
- Stickler CI

## 🗜️ Setup & Usage

Using this project should be fairly straightforward. There are however some prerequisites for your system in order to run this program:
 - You must have Ruby installed. Don't know if you have it installed or how to install it? [Follow this guide](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
 - You must have the Ruby on Rails gem installed. To install, simply run `gem install rails` in your terminal or enter `rails -v` to verify if it is installed already. [Need help? Head here.](http://railsapps.github.io/installing-rails.html)
 - Once you have the above sorted, install the 'RestClient' gem. Enter the follwing into your terminal: `gem install rest-client`. It should complete without any problems.

Once all of the above is completed and you have this repository downloaded to your machine, open your terminal, `cd` into the root of this repository and enter `ruby search.rb` into your terminal to run the app.
